Defined when creating a Notification Channel. You create it once per channel.


NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_NONE        // No sound or visual interruption

NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT     // Makes sound, shows in UI
NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH        // Makes sound, heads-up

val channel = NotificationChannel(
    "my_channel_id",
    "General Notifications",
    NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
)

Used directly in the notification builder to control importance at runtime (no channels).
f you set PRIORITY_HIGH but the channel has IMPORTANCE_LOW, the notification won’t show heads-up or sound. The channel setting always wins on API 26+.

| Priority Constant  | Value | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIORITY_MIN`     | -2    | Silent and hidden in the status bar.                                             |
| `PRIORITY_LOW`     | -1    | Silent, shows in the shade (notification drawer) but **no heads-up**.            |
| `PRIORITY_DEFAULT` | 0     | Standard priority. Plays sound if set, shows icon, no heads-up by default.       |
| `PRIORITY_HIGH`    | 1     | Interruptive. Plays sound and shows as a **heads-up** notification (if allowed). |
| `PRIORITY_MAX`     | 2     | Most intrusive. Used for urgent, full-screen notifications like alarms or calls. |


val builder = NotificationCompat.Builder(context, "my_channel_id")
